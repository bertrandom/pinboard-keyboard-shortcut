There are a lot of Pinboard Chrome Extensions and they all suck. Even the [official one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinboard-tools/dpaohcncbmkojcpcjaojcehdlnjfbjkl?hl=en). 

All I want to do is hit Command-D and have it open up a dialog to save the current page. 

That's **all**.

I don't want to sync my bookmarks to my browser.

I don't want to click on a toolbar button.

I just want to hit Command-D and have it bookmark the page.

That's what this does in 35 lines of code and most of those lines are empty.
